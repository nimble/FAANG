> Honestly speaking, the reason why I'm grinding out Leetcode is not only for interview prep but to prove myself a point. With sheer hardwork & determination I too can become good at solving algorithms. Always thought that people were born with natural talent were the ones that could solve these problems but then I came to a realization that why would God limit someones abilities? Sure it may take us a bit longer but giving up? NOPE, that should not be an option at all.
